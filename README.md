## Practical Machine Learning 

Using data available in http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har we try to predict the Classe (State of a person)  

* This involves cleaning of variables available.    
* Taking relevant variables only.  
* Using various Machine Learning Algorithms and evaluating them.  
* Picking the best Algorithm and predicting based on algorithm.
